# space-efficient-zero-knowledge-proofs
Sublinear-space ZKP system in Rust: a streaming prover that uses only O(√T) memory to commit wires/Z/Q via KZG (BN254) with blocked IFFT and aggregate-only Fiat–Shamir. Supports eval/coeff bases, deterministic dev SRS, and pairing checks. Includes CLI prover/verifier and tests.
